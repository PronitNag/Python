# Python Variable and String Exercises

## Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types

### Basic Variable Exercises

**2-1. Simple Message**
Create a file called `simple_message.py` that assigns a message to a variable and prints it.

```python
x=15
print(x)
```

**2-2. Simple Messages**
Create a file called `simple_messages.py` that assigns a message to a variable, prints it, then changes the value and prints the new message.

```python
x=15
print(x)
x=20
print(x)
```

### String Manipulation Exercises

**2-3. Personal Message**
Create a file called `personal_message.py` that uses a variable to represent a person's name and prints a message to that person.
Example output: "Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?"

```python
x="Pronit"
print(x +" how are you")
```

```python
name = "Pronit"

# Create and print a personalized message
message = f"Hello {name}, would you like to learn some Python today?"
print(message)
```

**2-4. Name Cases**
Create a file called `name_cases.py` that stores a person's name in a variable and prints it in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.


**2-5. Famous Quote**
Create a file called `famous_quote.py` that prints a quote and its author.
Example output: Albert Einstein once said, "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."

**2-6. Famous Quote 2**
Create a file called `famous_quote_2.py` that stores the famous person's name in a variable called `famous_person` and the quote in a variable called `message`, then prints the message.

**2-7. Stripping Names**
Create a file called `stripping_names.py` that stores a person's name with whitespace characters (\t and \n), then prints it with and without whitespace using `lstrip()`, `rstrip()`, and `strip()`.

### Number Exercises

Create a file that prints the number 8 four times, each using a different operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Example line: `print(5+3)`

**2-9. Favorite Number**
Create a file called `favorite_number.py` that stores your favorite number in a variable, then creates and prints a message revealing your favorite number.

### Programming Practice

**2-10. Adding Comments**
Add comments to two programs you've written to explain what they do. If your programs are simple, just add your name, the date, and a brief description.
