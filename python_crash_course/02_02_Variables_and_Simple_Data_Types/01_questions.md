# Python Variable and String Exercises

## Chapter 2 - Variables and Simple Data Types

### Basic Variable Exercises

**2-1. Simple Message**
Create a file called `simple_message.py` that assigns a message to a variable and prints it.<br/>

```python
x=15
print(x)
```

**2-2. Simple Messages**
Create a file called `simple_messages.py` that assigns a message to a variable, <br/>
prints it, then changes the value and prints the new message.

```python

x=20
print(x)
```

### String Manipulation Exercises

**2-3. Personal Message**
Create a file called `personal_message.py` that uses<br/>
a variable to represent a person's name and prints a message to that person.<br/>

```python
x="Pronit"
print(x +" how are you")

name = "Pronit"

# Create and print a personalized message
message = f"Hello {name}, would you like to learn some Python today?"
print(message)
```

**2-4. Name Cases**<br/>

**2-7. Stripping Names**<br/>
Create a file called `stripping_names.py` that stores a person's name<br/>

Example line: `print(5+3)`<br/>

**2-9. Favorite Number**<br/>
Create a file called `favorite_number.py` that stores your favorite<br/>

your favorite number.<br/>
